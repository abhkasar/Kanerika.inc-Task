**House Price Prediction**
This project aims to build a regression model to predict house prices using a given dataset. The tasks include data cleaning, data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and providing explanations and suggestions for improvements.

**Task 1: Data Preprocessing**
1. Importing Libraries: Imported required libraries to perform regression task.
2. Loading the Dataset: The dataset was loaded using Python's pandas library.
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Validated if any missing values present in given dataset, but not found any.
4. Feature Selection : Used VIF(Variance inflation factor) feature selection technique to select correlated features.
5. Splitting the Data: The data was split into training and testing sets with a test size of 20%.

**Task 2: Regression**
1. Training the Model: The Linear Regression model was trained on the training data.
2. Evaluating Model Performance: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R2_Score was used as the evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance on the test data.
3. Model's Predictions : From test data taken input values to make predictions.
   
**Suggestions for Improvements**
We can do improvements which includes feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, model interpretability, and continuous refinement of data preprocessing steps.
